# MentalAI 
![Header](plots/header.png)  

MentalAI is a retrieval-augmented system for mental health support with fine-tuned suicide prediction. It leverages **llama.cpp**, reverse engineered **GPT2** and **LangChain** to provide AI-assisted conversations based on retrieved contextual information. The overall idea is to combine clinical expert knowledge with empathy and therapeutical experience by combining finetuned emotion and suicidality classifiers with academic, therapeutic and conversational knowledge documents.
